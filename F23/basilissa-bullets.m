## βασίλισσα: an Athenian public position

1. Xen. *Oec*. 9.15 (late in Xen's life? 360s BCE?): Ischomachus' wife should act like the βασίλισσα 
2. Demosthenes, *Against Neaera* (ca. 340 BCE):  in olden times, the king performed sacrifice, and the his wife performed the holiest and most secret rites, εἰκότως, βασίλιννα οὖσα
3. Aristotle, *Constitution of Athens* (B.L. Papyrus 131) (320s BCE): the "wife of the king" takes part in a ritual marriage with the king and Dionysus
4. Julius Pollux (Ἰούλιος Πολυδεύκης), *Onomasticon* (late 2nd c. C.E.) 8.90: the wife of the ἄρχων  βασιλεύς is called βασίλιννα


## Counter argument

1. βασίλισσα is not attested before Xenophon. It spreads widely with Macedonian conquests in the 4th c. BCE. Is it a Macedonian term?
2. The Athenian official is repeatedly called "the wife of the ἄρχων  βασιλεύς".  Does this mean the term βασίλισσα/βασίλιννα is not authentic?
