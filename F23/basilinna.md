## The ἄρχων  βασιλεύς 

- known, among others, from Aristotle, *Constitution of Athens*)
- presided over homicide cases in the Areopagus
- religious responsibilities included supervision of mystery cult


## βασίλισσα

1. Xen. *Oec*. 9.15 (late in Xen's life? 360s BCE?): Ischomachus' wife should act like the βασίλισσα 
2. Demosthenes, *Against Neaera* (ca. 340 BCE):  in olden times, the king performed sacrifice, and the his wife performed the holiest and most secret rites, εἰκότως, βασίλιννα οὖσα
3. Aristotle, *Constitution of Athens* (B.L. Papyrus 131) (320s BCE): the "wife of the king" takes part in a ritual marriage with the king and Dionysus
4. Julius Pollux (Ἰούλιος Πολυδεύκης), *Onomasticon* (late 2nd c. C.E.) 8.90: the wife of the ἄρχων  βασιλεύς is called βασίλιννα


## Counter argument

1. βασίλισσα is not attested before Xenophon. It spreads widely with Macedonian conquests in the 4th c. BCE.
2. The official is repeatedly called "the wife of the ἄρχων  βασιλεύς"
