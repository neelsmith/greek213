## Sight reading: the opening of Xenophon's *Oeconomicus*

##### ἤκουσα δέ ποτε αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ οἰκονομίας τοιάδε διαλεγομένου.

## A regular practice to cultivate

1. Segment the sentence into *verbal expressions* (expressions with a subject/verb idea)
    1. Find a verb form (explicit or implicit)
    1. For principal (main) clauses, look for connecting word (conjunction or particle) connecting it to the rest of the text
    1. For subordinate constructions, identify the kind of subordination:
        1. clause: look for connecting word (conjunctions, relative pronoun)
        2. indirect statement (with infintive or participle)
        3. participle: look for agreement with noun or or pronoun
2. Fully identify the verb form in each verbal expression:
    1. Match tense and voice with principal part
    2. Match transitional vowel between stem and ending with mood
    3. Use ending to give you person and number
3. Work out fuller syntax of each verbal expression:
    1. semantics: transitive, intransitive or linking?
    2. subject (if expressed) 
    2. objects of active or middle verb (if any)
    2. agent of passive verb (if any)
