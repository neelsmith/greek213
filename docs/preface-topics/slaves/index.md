# Slaves (οἰκέται) in the household

> Contributed by McKenna Kelleher

Ancient Greece was a slave society from as early as 700 BCE. Most of these slave systems relied on the importation of new slaves (οἰκέται) as they were not yet self reproducing. At the time of the *Oeconomicus*, foreign born slaves outnumbered those born in Athens. Most of these slaves were taken from Thrace, Phrygia and other Middle Eastern territories. During the period of Xenophon, slaves made up one third of the Athenian population. These slaves were accessible to average citizens, as well as the wealthy. Wealthy Athenian citizens owned as many as fifty slaves. 

Slaves were included within the Ancient Greek household (οἶκος). The household was understood to be more than the physical home, but instead the property, land, and in a more economic sense, the estate or business. Slaves were needed for this economic structure to function. Male slaves were used for agriculture to look after plants, poultry and other domestic animals. Women typically worked inside the home. Women’s work included weaving, cooking and ensuring the household was clean. 

There was a hierarchy between the household slaves. Some slaves took on a supervising role in the house or fields and trained other slaves (e.g., the ταμία discussed in *Oeconomicus* 9). Slaves could not refuse any orders from their owners. The male head of the household could choose to murder one of his slaves without the risk of punishment, although this may not make economic sense.   
	
Xenophon’s *Oeconomicus* has informed much of what is known about slavery in Ancient Greece. The passage 9.10-9.13 describes in detail the duties and expectations of the ταμία, who oversaw the other household slaves (οἰκέται). The ταμία served as the head of the hierarchy of slaves within the Greek household. She was appointed by the owner of the household (οἶκος) because she showed the most temperance (ἐγκρατεστάτη 9.11). She showed this self control of eating (γαστρὸς 9.11), drinking (οἴνου 9.11), sleeping (ὕπνου 9.11) and sex (ἀνδρῶν συνουσίας 9.11). 

The ταμία was chosen strategically, and furthermore, taught (ἐπαιδεύομεν 9.12) to fulfill her duties. Through training, and even shared success, it was instilled in the ταμία to be eager to improve the household (προθυμεῖσθαι δὲ συναύξειν τὸν οἶκον 9.12). She would be given greater wealth (πλουσιώτερον 9.13) and freedom (ἐλευθεριώτερον 9.13) if she carried out her position with justice (9.13). 

The ταμία would be in charge of distributing items to the other household slaves and later recollecting and ensuring that all of the items were accounted for. This action required trust between the head of the household and the ταμία, and thus this overseer was an important member of the οἶκος.
