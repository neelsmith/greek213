# Religious Practice and practitioners

> Contributed by Isabel Sullivan


## Background

Greek religious practice and Greek mythology were two different aspects of what we might call ancient Greek religion, which often overlapped but not in a one-to-one way. There were no sacred texts or clergy as we would conceive of it. Priests of certain deities would tend to certain cults, but they did not constitute a system of priests that made up a clergy. Greek myths were not set in stone, and often changed based on region, time period, and even contemporaneous literature. 

## Elements of religious practice



> **TBA** We need background on regular calendrically scheduled ritual, which could include sacrifice, and belonged to different communities of participants (family, clan, polis, panhellenic identity).  This discussion could make specific cross reference to the kinds of activity implied by Ischomachus' inventory of his house in *Oeconomicus* 9.

Prayer would consist of three individual parts for the Greeks: Invocation, Sanction, and Entreaty. Invocation, literally meaning to call upon, addresses and invokes a deity’s name. Sanction, where the one praying mentions their religious piety to the guide. Entreaty is the part of the prayer where the votary makes his or her request of the deity. Most prayers were not prayers of praise but of petition for practical concerns. Sacrifices were rendered to deities for special favors and to appease the deities. Sacrifices usually consisted of the slaughter of domesticated animals during both private and public rituals accompanied by hymns. 

## Practitioners


> **TBA** See note in previous section: we should offer context on what communities could participate in what activities.


Unlike more modern conceptions of who could celebrate religious practices, both men and women were able to preside over sacred rituals. Certain cults would have distinct practices (some presided over by men, some by women, some by both.) Both private and public services were permissible. In the home, both men and women had distinct roles to play with private rituals. Men performed most of the familial rites, while women would make devotions, sacrifices, and shrines for gods. Women’s role in religious funerary practice was especially important. Many lekythoi depict women tending to graves, providing libations and fulfilling death rites. Scholars are still trying to pinpoint more on women’s role in the domestic setting as there are not many sources.
