# Athenian political institutions 


> Contributed by Meagan Warren

Different parts of Athens were governed by different bodies. One of the Athenian political institutions was the Council of 500. The Council of 500 (also called ἡ βουλή) was a group of 500 citizens (land-owning males) over the age of 30. 50 men chosen from each tribe made up the 500 men of the Council. The Council had the important job of representing the people and voting on issues. They would scrutinize the archons (state officers) and the new men chosen for the Council. Additionally, they would look after general affairs of the state, such as building and fixing the fleet, inspecting public buildings, and reviewing the calvary, in which circumstance, they had the discretionary power to reject men or horses they deemed unfit. 


Additionally, in the Greek world, there were public officials (νομοφύλαξ) who served as guardians of the law, selected by lot. These magistrates were in charge of ensuring that no unconstitutional actions occurred in the city and of confirming that all elected officials were acting constitutionally. Some doubt whether or not these officials could be found in Athens, while others claim that there were seven such functionaries in Athens. 


> **TBA** A little more detail with a more evolutionary perspective would be helpful. It would be useful to indicate briefly our main sources outside of Xenophon for knowing about these offices, and to give an idea of how they might have changed over time, and what they might have been like in Xenophon's time.
