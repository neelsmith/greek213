# Socratic background to the *Oeconomicus*

> Contributed by Aidan Jarvis

Xenophon uses the principles of the Socratic dialogue to outline both the fundamentals of household management and deeper philosophical ideals for life as a whole. What are the principles of Socratic dialogue? One must ask why, in the text, Socrates is constantly asking for explanations in order to reach the core concepts of conducting the management of one’s household. This leads to the uncovering of how women are viewed, how slaves ought to be treated, the values of respect and transparency, and many more avenues of life. Xenophon takes something such as household management, which is generally viewed in the realm solely of business, and is attempting to bring the reader or listener further into not only what it means to manage, but what it means to be a human being.

Often philosophy can leave many questions unanswered and pose ideas but not come to concrete conclusions. However, the use of Socratic questioning widdles down a conversation and a train of thought to the true root of someone’s argument. The *Oeconomicus* is arranged as a conversation that attempts to produce concrete thoughts. Socrates poses questions and Ischomachus' real life experiences between him and his wife, his slaves, and the world around him, to answer these questions to the best of his ability. This is what fosters the *Oeconomicus* to portray a convincing argument. This also allows this text to provide incredibly valuable insight into the day to day life of a Greek household. Through the critical examination that Socratic dialogue produces, the *Oeconomicus* brings into question various qualities of human nature and as a byproduct, raises relatively progressive beliefs that are often hard to find in antiquity.

> We need more basic background. What *is* a "Socratic dialog"? The newcomer to Xeonophon's text needs to know that Socrates never wrote anything, that we know about Socrates primarily through the works of Plato, that the works of Plato are are almost always in dialog form, and then how the form of the *Oeconomicus* resembles the form of Plato's dialogs. It might also be worth referring to the relative chronology of Xenophon and Plato to note that what might suggest about the relation of both authors to an actual historical practice of dialog by Socrates.
