# Xenophon's life

> Contributed by Emma Crain

Xenophonâ€™s personal life greatly impacted his writing, particularly in *Oeconomicus*. His use of Socratic dialogue creates a sense of common discussion amongst readers and the narrators of the text. This essay explores household management that was present in ancient Greece. Much of the writing he describes through this novel is based on his own experiences living in Greece, and how he interacted with others. Although some parts may be left ambiguous to the reader, his text is able to be analyzed as a historically accurate account of life in ancient Greece.

Xenophon was born around 355 BCE in ancient Athens, Greece. As he was born into a wealthy family, he was able to witness many important events that took place during this time. He studied under Socrates and was passionate about his own education. Xenophon became a member of the army under King Cyrus the Younger, which was written about in his *Anabasis* following his arrival back home from battle. He continued writing accounts of his life through many famous works, including *Oeconomicus.* He was ultimately exiled from Athens, Greece, but continued to share his stories through writing. His philosophies have been deemed as controversial, but his exile is a possible ruling as to why he moved away from Athenian democracy.
