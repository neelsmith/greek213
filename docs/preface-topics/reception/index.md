# Reception of the *Oeconomicus*

> Contributed by Will O'Neill

Xenophon’s career makes it difficult to clearly categorize him as an author. His works defy traditional boundaries of genres, dealing with historical, military, political, philosophical, and practical topics. In the modern age, scholars have made the decision to consider him as foremost a military historian, but this was not always the case. In fact, throughout antiquity up until the early modern period, Xenophon was considered foremost to be a philosopher. His Socratic dialogues do not currently possess the same level of fame as Plato’s dazzling philosophical writings, but thinkers from the past twenty-four hundred years have held much debate about where Xenophon fits into the traditional canon of the ancient philosophers. The *Oeconomicus* presented many ideas which would have been seen as foreign to classical Athenians: that a man’s capacity for virtue is equal to a woman’s capacity for virtue, that women are capable of engaging in Socratic dialogue, and that the role of a mother is equal to that of the father when it comes to raising children well.


> **TBA**: we should insert a concise summary here (a sentence or two) of evidence for reading the *Oeconomicus* in antiquity and the middle ages, so that a phrase like "so well received by Roman writers" is clear to the reader of the commentary.

As a military commander, Xenophon was a very direct and practical man. His version of his mentor and friend Socrates is more concerned with questions about how best to navigate the real world, (as opposed to the metaphysical inquisitions on the ideas of love, justice, and the soul’s immortality of Plato’s Socrates). It was precisely for this reason that Xenophon was so well-received by Roman writers. Cicero’s translation of Xenophon’s *Oeconomicus* was very popular at the time of the late republic, and proponents of traditional stern Roman morality  praised Xenophon for his emphasis on self-control and prudence. Manuscripts of Cicero’s Latin translation were rediscovered during the Italian Renaissance, where they were translated into the vernacular and became incredibly popular reading.

This text, and its depiction of the *kalos kagathos*, held strong until the 20th century, when philosophers like Leo Strauss interpreted Xenophon’s description of the meeting between Socrates and Ischomachus as ironic, where Ischomachus’ portrayal as a wise estate manager is undermined by the possibility that this is the same Ischomachus whose was disgraced in Athens when his wife became pregnant by their son-in-law. There are two streams of philosophical reception. One is more generous, and views Xenophon as being authentic and partial to the concept of the kalokagathos and the ability of a woman to be more capable than traditionally considered by classical Athenians. The other is more critical, which sees Xenophon as satirizing the role of the *kalokagathos* and mocking the concept that Ischomachus’ wife is really responsible for her husband’s success. For the most part the ancients and the medievals have been more inclined to the initial view, as it would be unfitting for Xenophon, a military man used to straightforward language to use such subversive rhetorical devices to communicate his message, while some classicists and philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were more skeptical of Xenophon’s intentions.
