# Property Rights and Inheritance

> Contributed by Leo Figge

Within the realm of ancient Greece, women were considered neither citizens nor worthy of political rights. In all the city-states that made up ancient Greece, the role of women varied when it came to position in society and the opportunities they might have had. Specifically Athenian women were inferior to men at seemingly every point of their life and their daily lives mostly consisted of tending to their children and taking care of the household (Seitkasimova 5). However, women did play a crucial part in the transferral of property and inheritance in ancient Athenian society.

Inheritance and the accompanying property was a significant concern once someone passed away in Athens. The system for dividing this property was through lineage, yet this lineage took both sides of the family into account. If a woman’s husband passed away suddenly, the property and inheritance would be passed down through her to their sons. So oftentimes, men from wealthy Athenian families would marry within their own lineage to maintain the property and wealth (Foxhall 2). This made women an integral part of households and inheritance since they were the sole means by which some men were related to each other. In some extreme cases, women could be left on their own if their father had and brothers had passed away. In these cases, the woman became an “epikleros” and what she could do truly depended on her “age, wealth, and marital status” (Foxhall 5). Marrying an “epikleros” could yield a large inheritance for a prospective husband, yet it would not fully be his until the couple had children. Despite the possibility of being an “epikleros,” the legal proceedings surrounding property rights and inheritance after a wealthy citizen’s death could get quite complicated. Women typically had to be represented by a man in court which makes it increasingly difficult for women to argue for their right to an inheritance. The wills that some men created at this time meant virtually nothing as they were usually never honored. Wills were typically meant to act as a guide in drastic cases if the deceased’s children were underage. However, if a will directed one’s money to be donated or given to a daughter, a simple dispute in court would usually award the inheritance to the closest male relative of the deceased.

In general, property rights were very limited for women in Athens and the legal passing down of property or inheritance was pretty ambiguous in some cases. A woman's property was truly only belonging to her for her lifetime since the men in her life would decide where it goes after her passing. Additionally, women seemed to have been only a means for a relationship between men in most cases, just a route through which property could be passed down. Finally, households had lots of intertwined and intricate relationships which made this process difficult and left women out of the equation entirely in most cases.
