# Conditions about present and past time



## Simple factual conditions

Simple factual conditions referring to specific or definite actions in the present or past use the indicative in both protasis and apodosis.

Example in present time (present indicative):

> εἰ δὲ  ἐπιτρέπει τις τὸν ἄλλου οἶκον αὐτῷ, δύναται εὖ οἰκεῖν.
>
> If someone entrusts another person's household to him, he is able to manage it well.


Example in past time (these are both imperfect, but could just as easily use aorist):


> εἰ δὲ  ἐπέτρεπε τις τὸν ἄλλου οἶκον αὐτῷ, ἐδύνατο εὖ οἰκεῖν.
>
> If someone entrusted another person's household to him, he was able to manage it well.



## Generalizing conditions

Greek can emphasize that a conditional statement is generalizing by using an indicative apodosis with a particular protasis: for present time, ἐάν + the subjunctive, for past time εἰ + the optative.


Present general:

> ἐὰν δὲ  ἐπιτρέπῃ τις τὸν ἄλλου οἶκον αὐτῷ, δύναται εὖ οἰκεῖν.
>
> If (ever) someone entrusts another person's household to him, he is able to manage it well.


Past general:

> εἰ δὲ  ἐπιτρέποι τις τὸν ἄλλου οἶκον αὐτῷ, ἐδύνατο εὖ οἰκεῖν.
>
> If (ever) someone entrusted another person's household to him, he was able to manage it well.


## Contrary-to-fact conditions

Contrafactual conditions are easily recognized by the addition of the particle ἄν  to the indicative apodosis.  Both protasis and apodosis normally uses a "remote" tense of the indicative: for present contrary to fact, an imperfect indicative, for past contrary to fact, an aorist indicative.


Present contrary to fact:

> εἰ δὲ  ἐπέτρεπε τις τὸν ἄλλου οἶκον αὐτῷ, ἐδύνατο ἂν εὖ οἰκεῖν.
>
> If someone was (right now) entrusting another person's household to him, he would be able to manage it well (but that's not what's really happening).



Past contrary to fact:

> εἰ δὲ  ἐπέτρεψε τις τὸν ἄλλου οἶκον αὐτῷ, ἐδυνήσατο ἂν εὖ οἰκεῖν.
>
> If someone had (in the past) entrusted another person's household to him, he would  have been able to manage it well (but that never happened).





# Conditions about future time

Conditional statements about future time can either be *more vivid* (very confident) or *less vivid* (less confident).  More vivid future conditions use the future indicative for the apodosis; the protasis usis the subjunctive mood +  ἄν.  Less vivid future conditions use the optative in both protasis and apodosis; they are easily recognized by the addition of ἄν to the apodosis.


Future more vivid:

> ἐὰν δὲ  ἐπιτρέπῃ τις τὸν ἄλλου οἶκον αὐτῷ, δυνήσαται εὖ οἰκεῖν.
>
> If someone entrusts another person's household to him, he will (for sure) be able to manage it well.



Future less vivid:


> εἰ δὲ  ἐπιτρέποι τις τὸν ἄλλου οἶκον αὐτῷ, δύναιτο ἂν εὖ οἰκεῖν.
>
> If someone entrusted another person's household to him (in the future), would be able to manage it well (but I'm not too certain that that will happen).
