# Greek 102-01, S'23: home page


## Announcements

- Final [project](./project/): complete draft due May 3
- Reminder: no classes on Wednesday, Apr. 26 (Academic Symposium)





## Weeks at a glance:  Apr. 24 - May 5

We read continuous passages of Lysias 1. Lobby for your favorite passage to read together!  Some candidates:

- sections 24-26: the climax of the narration, and killing of Eratosthenes. "I'm not the one killing you: it's the laws of the city!"
- sections 46-48: Euphiletos' closing argument to the jury.  "I did this on behalf of the city!"


Keep these resources and notes at hand:

- summaries of some grammatical points:  [reference and review](./reference/)
- how to approach [reading assignments](./assignments/reading-how-to/)



## Notes and review

Some important vocabulary:

- ἀποθνῄσκω, ἀποθανοῦμαι, ἀπέθανον, (ἀπο)τέθνηκα, -, -  "to die"


Some truly obscure vocabulary!

- ψιμυθιόω (regular omicron contract): from ψιμύθιον, -ου, τό, "white lead" (used as a pigment). "to apply (white lead) makeup"
