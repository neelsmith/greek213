# How to have a Socratic conversation in Greek

- one interlocutor is Socrates
- the verb for the conversation is διαλέγεσθαι (middle voice)
- the conversation proceeds via questions


## Forming questions

- ἆρα introduces a yes/no question; ἆρά γε "adds liveliness and emphasis" (Denniston). Usually first word in sentence.
- ἦ also asks a yes/no question, often as a *follow up* question, and can imply that it's actually posing the answer to a preceding question. ἦ καὶ is especially "eager"!

## Responding to questions

- ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ.


## Drawing conclusions

- ἄρα (postpositive, and note the accent!) makes a connection
- γοῦν "part proof": introduces a statement which is evidence for the preceding statement
