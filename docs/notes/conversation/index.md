# How to have a Socratic conversation in Greek

- one interlocutor is Socrates
- the verb for the conversation is διαλέγεσθαι (middle voice).  Note that the conversation itself is a λόγος, so the verb can mean something like "mutually work through our λόγος."
- the conversation proceeds via questions


## Forming questions

- ἆρα introduces a yes/no question; ἆρά γε "adds liveliness and emphasis" (Denniston). Usually first word in sentence.
- ἦ also asks a yes/no question, often as a *follow up* question, and can imply that it's actually posing the answer to a preceding question. ἦ καὶ is especially "eager"!
- οὐκοῦν (circumflex on ultima) are "pre-eminently suited to the even, unemotional character of intellectual discussion" (Denniston), and perhaps even occurs uniquely in dialogs of Plato and Xenophon.  It normally introduces a next step in an argument, even if posed as a question: "So then... ?"


## Responding to questions

Agreement:

- ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ.
- οὕτως
- πάνυ μὲν οὖν

## Advancing the argument

- τοι "Its primary function is to bring home to the comprehension of the person addressed a truth of which he is ignorant, or temporarily oblivious" (Dennsion).



## Drawing conclusions

- ἄρα (postpositive, and note the accent!) makes a connection
- γοῦν "part proof": introduces a statement which is evidence for the preceding statement
