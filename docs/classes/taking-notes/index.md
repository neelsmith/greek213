# Collaboration and note taking


## Forming teams

Please complete [this Google form](https://forms.gle/wAi9oZjsK8xTeK2b6) before class: that will help me make up initial teams for our collaborative commentary. 

## Markdown

In our commentary project, we'll take notes in plain-text files, structured with Markdown.


Markdown is a simple text-formatting convention that is designed to be human readable even as plain text.

1. Read through this [summary of Markdown syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/) from the CommonMark website.  (In general, when there are two options, prefer the syntax in the left column, with the sole exception of the bulleted list: for that case, use `-` rather than `*`.)
2. Try at least the beginning of the CommonMark [10-minute Markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

## Obsidian

In our commentary project, we'll edit Markdown files with the note-taking app,Obsidian.

1. Download and install the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian).
2. Read through this guide on [how to get started taking notes with Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault).

## Assignment

1. Before coming to class, use Obsidian to create a brief bio for inclusion in our commentary. The name of the note should be your name, as you want it to appear in our commentary.  At a minimum, give your graduating class, major and college.
2. Find the bio file you just created on your computer, and add it to your personal directory on the course Google Drive.
