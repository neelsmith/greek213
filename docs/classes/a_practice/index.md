# A practice of reading

## Contexts to consider

Whenever we read a text, we need to be aware of many contexts: who was the author and the expected audience for the work? What is the time period and genre of the work?

In the Introduction to Sewell's commentary ([pdf here](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/Oeconomicus-Sewell.pdf)), read pp. ix-xii. 

## Habits of reading

In class and in our group assignments outside of class, we will follow a regular routine in approaching a Greek text.

1. isolate verbal expressions
1. fully identify verb forms, and the construction of each verbal expression
1. progressing from syntactically independent verbal expressions to dependent expressions, identify forms and syntax of vocabulary
1. synthesize helpful material from commentaries


## The language of Socratic dialog

As the opening sentence of the *Oeconomicus* tells us, this text presents an example of διαλέγεσθαι, which unfolds through questions.  Reading dialog of this kind presents its own special challenges: it can be very elliptical (like our own conversations), and you will encounter new vocabulary items specific to this kind of dicussion.

In the following passage, try to apply the sequential process summarized above.  (Feel free to work through the text with classmates!) Particles can be especially important pointers to the flow of the dialog.  In this selection, what does the particle ἆρα tell us?  There are also two instances of the particle γε. How do they situate their verbal expressions in relation to the flow of the dialog?


> ἤκουσα δέ ποτε αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ οἰκονομίας τοιάδε διαλεγομένου: εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ Κριτόβουλε, ἆρά γε ἡ οἰκονομία ἐπιστήμης τινὸς ὄνομά ἐστιν, ὥσπερ ἡ ἰατρικὴ καὶ ἡ χαλκευτικὴ καὶ ἡ τεκτονική; ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ, ἔφη ὁ Κριτόβουλος.
