# Reading with commentaries

## Citation and reference

Scholarly instruments for reading Greek (such as commentaries and lexica) rely on *canonical citation* -- an agreed upon, standard way to identify a passage of text, regardless of edition or translation.  Outside of Greek and Latin literature, canonical citation may be familiar to you from the practice of citing Biblical texts by book/chapter/verse, or of citing legal documents  by paragraph or section (or "article", in the case of the US Constitution).

What is the canonical reference scheme for identifying passages of Xenophon's *Oeconomicus* ?  Compare how passages are cited in two or more of your editions with commentary of the *Oeconomicus*.

The digital texts in the library of the Scaife Viewer also rely on canonical citation to retrieve passages of text. Visit the [Scaife Viewer's edition of the *Oeconomicus*](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg003.perseus-grc2:/), and set the passage reference to display sections 1.1 through 1.3.

In class, we'll apply to these sections the same approach to reading that we began in the first week of class, but will now add a further step of consulting commentaries on the passage we're reading.

## Intentions

Read the programmatic or introductory statements in each of the following commentaries:

- pp. 97-101 of Sarah Pomeroy's 1994 commentary (mediocre PDF available on [course Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hXQ600FaFdCJPisyyHXLCIQvYnmo068X)).
- pp. v-vi, to Ralph Doty's 1994 commentary.
- the "Prefatory Note" to A.H.N. Sewell's 1925 commentary ([pdf](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/Oeconomicus-Sewell.pdf)).
- the two-page "Preface" to Hubert Holden's 1884 commentary ([pdf](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/Oeconomicus-Holden.pdf)]).

Compare the aims of each commentator.  What kind of information do you expect to find in each commentary?
