# Preparatory inventory

We will prepare for commentary assignments 2-4 by compiling two initial inventories of our passage prior to submitting the markdown commentary.

1. *Inventory of verb forms*  
    - for each verb form in your passage, give the dictionary form (or *lemma*; normally the first principal part), fully identify:
        - for finite verbs identify it with TV-M-PN
        - for participles, identify as TV-GCN
        - for infinitives, identify as TV
    - give the principal part the form derives from (e.g., if the form is an aorist passive, give its sixth principal part)
2. *Inventory of syntax of verbal units*.  For each verbal expression:
    - identify the kind of expression: most frequently, one of main clause, subordinate clause, circumstantial or attributive participle, infinitive or participle in indirect statement
    - if the expression is a *clause*, find any coordinating word (e.g., main clause with a particle or conjunction; subordinate clause with a subordinating conjunction)
    - if a finite verb is *not* in the indicative mood, explain why
    - if a clause is part of a condition, explain the condition
    - find the subject and predicate of the expression:
       - for any verb form, you may find a subject (in the nominative case for finite verbs; usually in the accusative case with infinitives; participles agree with a substantive taking its case from its construction in the sentence, or genitive if used absolutely)
        - for transitive verbs, expect a direct object, most often in accusative case.  Use your lexicon and commentary to determine whether the verb is constructed with a different case (e.g., ἀκούω with the genitive case for the source of a sound versus accusative for a sound)
        - for linking verbs, expect a predicate (noun or adjective) in the same case as the subject
