## Inventory prior to commentary

Please compile an inventory of verb forms, and a syntactic inventory following [these guidelines](../inventory/).

Submit your inventory as a PDF with a file name that indicates it's the inventory for assignment 3.




## Preparing the Markdown commentary

1. Download the folder `xenophon-oeconomicus-commentary` from the course Google Drive and open it in Obsidian. You can search for your passage by reference, or scroll through the `reader` folder to find your passage.
2. You will see links you can click to create three distinct sets of comments: one for syntax, one for vocabulary, and a third for other or general commentary.
3. Add your group's notes. If you need to add formatting or structure, you can use markdown.  (See this [summary page](https://commonmark.org/help/)
3. You can proof your work by returning to the `reader` page: you additions should be automatically incorporated.
4. You will have created three new files, which will be named `commentary PASSAGEREF`, `vocab PASSAGEREF` and `syntax PASSAGEREF`.  When you're done, upload the three files to your google drive.  (Note that on your computer, the files will have a `.md` extension on the file name.)
