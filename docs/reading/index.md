# Preparing to read a passage

## 1. Identify the context in the text you're reading

## 2. Segment continuous text

- isolate *verbal expressions* (Highlighting convention for our class: indent to reflect level of subordination)
- in each verbal expression, identify a single verbal form expressing a subject/verb idea. (If you find more than one, then you have more than one verbal expression, and need to isolate each.)  Decide if the verb is transitive, intransive or a linking verb. (Highlighting convention for our class: bold the verbal form; color the verb red, green or blue for transitive, intransitive, or linking verb respectively)
- then, depending on the form of the verb:
    - for finite verb forms, find connecting particles or conjunctions (Highlighting convention for our class: bold face)
    - for circumstantial participles: find substantive it agrees with  (Highlighting convention for our class: underline the participle and the substantive)
    - for attributive participles: find the substantive it agrees with including article(s)(Highlighting convention for our class: underline the participle and article or articles connecting it to a substantive)
    - for participles or infinitives in indirect statement: find subject and predicate, if any, keeping in mind that we might have to distinguish a subject and direct object both expressed in accusative case.
    

## 3. Syntax analysis and construction

- fully identify all verbal forms, and identify the principal part the form is based on:
    - for finite verbs, identify as TV MPN
    - for participles, identify as  TV GCN
    - for infinitives, identify as  TV
- in each verbal expression, find subject and predicate, if any
    - for any verb form, you may find a subject (in the nominative case for finite verbs; usually in the accusative case with infinitives; participles agree with a substantive taking its case from its construction in the sentence, or genitive if used absolutely)
    - for *transitive verbs*, expect a direct object, most often in accusative case
    - for *linking* verbs, expect a predicate (noun or adjective) in the same case as the subject 

## 4. Vocabulary notes

For any difficult or unfamiliar vocabulary``:

- identify its dictionary form (the *lemma*), e.g., first principal part for verbs, nominative singular for nouns, masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular for adjectives
- note if it requires any unexpected construction (e.g., is it a deponent verb with no active forms? is it a verb that takes an object in a case other than the accusative? is a noun used only in plural?)
- note if the word has any special senses or context-specific meaning that are relevant to the passage you're reading


## 5. Consulting commentaries

Use external reference works like commentaries to note:

- any cultural or historical background you need to understand the passage, such as references to cultural practices requiring no explanation to the original audience, but foreign to us
- references to specific people or places
- catch all: any other unexpected, surprising or trouble aspects of the passage that you can't readily make sense of from the passage alone without further elaboration
