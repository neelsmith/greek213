# Goals

Greek 101 is the first semester of an ambitious new two-semester sequence to introduce you to the study of ancient Greek.  Our curriculum is inspired by the Latin 101-102 sequence developed by several members of our department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io), and shares a directly parallel set of overarching goals.  By the end of this course, you will:

- identify ways that  language structures our understanding of the world we live in
- articulate how the Greek language has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
- read and pronounce Greek with confidence and accuracy
- analyze syntax and sentence structure in Greek and English
- express complex ideas in written composition both in Greek and in English
- read authentic, unaltered Greek texts with minimal glossing
