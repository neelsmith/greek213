# Goals and objectives

Greek 213 builds on the content you mastered in Greek 101-102, and introduces you to reading a historical language.


By the end of this course, you will:


- develop habits of reading historical texts including:
    - recognizing the historical context and expectations of authors and intended audience
    - isolating verbal expressions, and understanding their construction
    - using scholarly instruments including lexica, reference grammars, and commentaries
- recognize the role of particles to guide your reading of classical Socratic dialog
- identify registers of speakers' language
- relate the philosophical discussion of the *Oeconomicus* to the concrete social institutions discussed or alluded to in the text
- synthesize commentary from multiple sources
- contribute to a collaborative commentary with an explicit target audience of second- and third-semester Greek students
