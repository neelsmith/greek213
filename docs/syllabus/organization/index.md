# Organization of the course



## Course material

The starting point for all course material is the course web site at [https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/). 


We will share work developing a collaborative commentary using [this course Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hXQ600FaFdCJPisyyHXLCIQvYnmo068X/).  We will use the `pdfs` folder to share reading selections from various sources. The `xenophon-oeconomicus-composite` folder has a text of the *Oeconomicus* in markdown format.

In addition, you have a personal folder on the course Google Drive where you will submit contributions to our collaborative commentary project.
