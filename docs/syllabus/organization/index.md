# Course organization and what to expect

The central activity in everything we do this semester is reading. Most of our time together in MWF classes will be devoted to reading, as a class and in small groups. We'll use that time to focus on specific practices that we will try to turn into habits. We will supplement these with pauses to review material from Greek 101-102.

Assignments outside of class will ask you to work through exactly the same approach to reading that we will practice in class.



## Course material

The starting point for all course material is the course web site at [https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/). 


We will share work developing a collaborative commentary using [this course Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hXQ600FaFdCJPisyyHXLCIQvYnmo068X/).  We will use the `pdfs` folder to share reading selections from various sources. The `xenophon-oeconomicus-composite` folder has a text of the *Oeconomicus* in markdown format.

In addition, you have a personal folder on the course Google Drive where you will submit contributions to our collaborative commentary project.



## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

- Schedule regular times both for newly assigned work and to review previously covered material.
- Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
- Practice reading Greek aloud. Vocalizing Greek and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
- When you are studying, focus only on Greek. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic devices. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Greek.
