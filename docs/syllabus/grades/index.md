# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in four categories:

1. brief in-class written and oral assessments
1. contributions to a collaborative commentary project
1. individually authored topics contributed to commentary project
4. class attendance and participation


All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.



## Individual assignments

For in-class assessments and individually authored topics contributed to commentary project, you can earn two points. The first point is for a *complete*, on-time submission.  If your work also satisfies all the requirements for a *satisfactory* submission, you earn a second point.  If your work is complete and on time, but some part of it is not satisfactory, you will have an unlimited number of opportunities to revise the submission by a given deadline.  For example, for short, in-class assessments, if you complete the work and earn the first point for the assignment, but have an error, you would typically have about a week to resubmit the work with corrections.  To resubmit an assignment, bring the revised work to office hours, or make an appointment to go over the revised work with Prof. Smith.


## Collaborative commentary
For our collaborative commentary project, you will in teams to develop a total of four submissions.  We will rotate team membership at mid semester, so that you will participate in one group for the first two submissions, and a different group for the second two submissions.

Each of the four submissions can earn three points.  The first point is for a *complete*, on-time submission from your group.  If your group's work also satisfies all the requirements for a *satisfactory* submission, all members of the group also earn a second point. At the conclusion of each submission, you will evaluate your own contributions and your teammates contributions, using a rubric that we will develop together and agree on prior to the first team assignment.  If the evaluation of your individual contribution satisfies the agreed-upon rubric, you will receive a third point.



## Attendance 

Being prepared and attending class earns up to 6 points in this category of your final course.  We have 27 scheduled class meetings. This table summarizes the scale of attendance points:

| Class meetings | Points earned |
| --- | --- |
| 26+ |  6 |
| 25 | 5 |
|24 | 4 |
|23 | 3 |
|22 | 2 |
|< 22 | 0 |



## Determination of final course grade


Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.
