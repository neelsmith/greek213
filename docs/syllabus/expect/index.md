# What to expect 

Reading. Together, apart. In class, out. Always reading.


## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

- Schedule regular times both for newly assigned homework and review of previously covered material.
- Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
- Practice your Greek aloud. Vocalizing Greek and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
- When you are studying, focus only on Greek. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic devices. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Greek.
