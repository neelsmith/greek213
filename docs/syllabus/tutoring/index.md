# Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics offers a peer-based tutoring program for intermediate Greek students. In 2023-2024, these will include scheduled review and practice sessions on topics we are covering or reviewing.  Please check the course website for dates and times, and for topics planned during the fall semester.
