# Goals

Greek 101 is the first semester of an ambitious new two-semester sequence to introduce you to the study of ancient Greek.  Our curriculum is inspired by the Latin 101-102 sequence developed by several members of our department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io), and shares a directly parallel set of overarching goals.  By the end of this course, you will:

  - identify ways that  language structures our understanding of the world we live in
  - articulate how the Greek language has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
  - read and pronounce Greek with confidence and accuracy
  - analyze syntax and sentence structure in Greek and English
  - express complex ideas in written composition both in Greek and in English
  - read authentic, unaltered Greek texts with minimal glossing




# Community-based learning

Community-based learning (CBL) is an essential part of our course.  We are privileged to be be able to study Greek together in our MWF class meetings.  In your CBL work, you will share some of that experience with others. Community-based learning helps us to understand our language study in a broader context. The active engagement it requires also will improve your development of the language skills required for your study of Greek.

Your CBL work will include a weekly CBL section meeting on campus, and a small-group project that will include work in the community.

In the fall semester of 2023, our community partners will be the Worcester Art Museum and the Worcester Public Schools.




# Organization of the course

## Textbook

The fall semester course is organized in four modules centered on four major ideas about the ancient Greek language. On our course website, each module identifies concrete objectives that will help you achieve the broader course goals summarized above.

The four modules correspond closely to modules 1-4 in the textbook we will be using, which you can purchase directly from the Classics Department office. The text will be available this fall in two installments:  packet 1 will be available the first week of classes; packet 2 will be available after fall break.  In addition, you can always find a current on-line version at [https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/), and can always download a current PDF of the textbook from [https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf](https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf).

After introducing features of the ancient Greek language, each module of the textbook includes reading that connects the topics you are studying to contemporary experience, and concludes with a reading selection from an authentic ancient text.  This year, our reading selections will be drawn from a defense speech composed by the orator Lysias in a murder trial.

Read sections 1 ("Hellênikê / ἑλληνική: an open-source introduction to ancient Greek") and 2 ("About this textbook") of the textbook to learn more about how the textbook is organized.

The textbook also has an accompanying youtube channel and playlist at [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhpSgbqjgokrwa4HmReaGEptvqURz6Ns](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhpSgbqjgokrwa4HmReaGEptvqURz6Ns).

## Technologies and mechanics of submitting assignments

All course material will be available on the course web site at [https://neelsmith.github.io/greek101/](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek101/).

Written assignments should be written clearly and legibly in dark pencil on paper.




# What to expect

There are no prerequisites for this course, and no individual concept we are going to cover this semester is particularly complex, but Greek 101-102 is a fast-paced sequence. At the beginning of the course, *everything* will be new, and you should expect that the hardest part of the entire 101-102 sequence (and maybe of any Greek course you ever take!) will be the first few weeks before fall break, because everything will be new.  Our course is organized so that these weeks introduce the  most frequent features of the language, so as you constantly reuse the material from the beginning of Greek 101, it will not only become increasingly automatic, but will give you a framework that will make it easier to learn further features of the language.

Some concepts may sink in immediately, and others may take more practice.  Review and practice are as important as your initial introduction to a topic, so every graded assignment offers you the opportunity to repeat it as often as you need in order to complete it satisfactorily.

Most of our class time together will be devoted to actively applying and using ideas from your class preparation. Since much of the value of this time results from your active engagement with course material, and cannot be replicated by passively watching someone else's involvement, I do not plan to record our class meetings.

## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

  - Schedule regular times both for newly assigned homework and review of previously covered material.
  - Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
  - Practice your Greek aloud. Vocalizing Greek and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
  - When you are studying, focus only on Greek. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic communications. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Greek.

## Work log

To help you gauge how effectively you are managing your work, I will ask you to keep a log of your work on Greek. You should note what days you worked on Greek and for how long.  You may also wish to note what kind of work you did: written homework, vocabulary review, or draft of a portfolio assignment, for example.

Your work logs will not be graded, but I will periodically ask you to summarize the number of days and hours per week you have worked on Greek, for anonymous submission. This will help me evaluate how to balance assignments as we progress through the year.




# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in three categories:

 1. written and oral assignments for class preparation
 2. longer portfolio assignments
 3. work in CBL lab

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

## Class preparation

The course schedule includes twenty brief assignments as part of your routine class preparation: one introductory Google form to complete, seventeen assignment to be submitted in writing, and two oral assignments. Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed *submission* by the specified deadline, and a second point for a grade of *satisfactory*. For written assignments, deadlines are 5:00 pm the day *before* class.

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; an error means that the assignment is not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected version as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

The total points you can earn in this category is 40.

## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of ten longer assignments. Four of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language by analyzing and explaining forms and constructions; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Greek; three  will be compositions in Greek.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meeting time to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

As with class preparation assignments, each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it fulfills all the requirements for a satisfactory grade.  Like class preparation assignments, portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module.

The total points you can earn in this category is 20.

## CBL lab

Throughout the year, you will participate in a weekly CBL lab led by an alumna or alumnus of last year's Greek 101/102 course.

You will receive two grades for CBL lab work.

  - participation: ten CBL sections are scheduled to meet at Holy Cross.  You earn one point for each section you attend, for a possible total of 10.
  - small0group project: satisfactory completion of projects in 3 steps. Each step can earn 2 points, for a total possible of 6 points.

The total points you can earn in this category is 16.

## Determination of final course grade

Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade | Portfolio (out of 20) | Class preparation (out of 40) | CBL  (out of 16) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 20 | 38 |   15 |
| A- | 20 | 36 |   15 |
| B+ | 18 | 36 |   14 |
| B | 17 | 35 |  13 |
| B- | 16 | 34 |   13 |
| C+ | 15 | 34 |   12 |
| C | 14 | 33 |   11 |
| C- | 13 | 32 |   10 |
| D | 12 | 31 |   8 |




# Policies

## Class attendance

Active participation in class is one of the most effective ways to learn ancient Greek.  My expectations for your class attendance follow the college policies posted at [https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext).

If at some point in the semester you are unable to complete the required preparation for a single class, please come anyway: staying away only compounds the difficulty of catching up.  If you let me know that you're not prepared, I will not call on you in class.

If you are experiencing symptoms of a communicable disease, please let me know and do *not* come to class.  If you are are unable to attend class for whatever reason, for a shorter or longer period of time, please get in touch with me so we can work out a plan to get you caught up.

## Diversity and Inclusivity

The study of the ancient Mediterranean world belongs to all of us: if you have chosen to study ancient Greek, then you belong here. The diversity that our student body brings to this class is a resource, a strength and a shared benefit for all of us.

In developing this course, our aim has been to make the course materials and our interactions with each other respectful of diversity of all kinds: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.  If you have suggestions about how to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups, please share them.

## Accommodations for disabilities

Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss support services available. The office can be reached by calling 508 793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 215A.

If you are already registered with Disability Services, please let me know as soon as possible, so that I can take account of this in planning for tests or other course activities.

## Academic integrity

You should be familiar with the College’s policy on Academic Integrity posted at
[https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext)




# Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee offer a peer-based tutoring program for Greek 101 students. The tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources, and can discuss course with ou, help you understand how to solve problems, and suggest independent learning strategies.

Tutoring workshops run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, at time arranged between you and the Peer Tutor. To set up an appointment with one of the tutors, please contact your professor.
