# Goals and objectives

Greek 213 builds on the content you mastered in Greek 101-102, and introduces you to reading a historical language.

By the end of this course, you will:

  - develop habits of reading historical texts including:
    
      + recognizing the historical context and expectations of authors and intended audience
      + isolating verbal expressions, and understanding their construction
      + using scholarly instruments including lexica, reference grammars, and commentaries
  - recognize the role of particles to guide your reading of classical Socratic dialog
  - identify registers of speakers' language
  - relate the philosophical discussion of the *Oeconomicus* to the concrete social institutions discussed or alluded to in the text
  - synthesize commentary from multiple sources
  - contribute to a collaborative commentary with an explicit target audience of second- and third-semester Greek students




# Course organization and what to expect

The central activity in everything we do this semester is reading. Most of our time together in MWF classes will be devoted to reading, as a class and in small groups. We'll use that time to focus on specific practices that we will try to turn into habits. We will supplement these with pauses to review material from Greek 101-102.

Assignments outside of class will ask you to work through exactly the same approach to reading that we will practice in class.

## Course material

The starting point for all course material is the course web site at [https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek213/).

We will share work developing a collaborative commentary using [this course Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hXQ600FaFdCJPisyyHXLCIQvYnmo068X/).  We will use the `pdfs` folder to share reading selections from various sources. The `xenophon-oeconomicus-composite` folder has a text of the *Oeconomicus* in markdown format.

In addition, you have a personal folder on the course Google Drive where you will submit contributions to our collaborative commentary project.

## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

  - Schedule regular times both for newly assigned work and to review previously covered material.
  - Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
  - Practice reading Greek aloud. Vocalizing Greek and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
  - When you are studying, focus only on Greek. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic devices. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Greek.

# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in four categories:

 1. brief in-class written and oral assessments
 2. contributions to a collaborative commentary project
 3. individually authored topics contributed to commentary project
 4. class attendance and participation

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

## Individual assignments

For in-class assessments and individually authored topics contributed to commentary project, you can earn two points. The first point is for a *complete*, on-time submission.  If your work also satisfies all the requirements for a *satisfactory* submission, you earn a second point.  If your work is complete and on time, but some part of it is not satisfactory, you will have an unlimited number of opportunities to revise the submission by a given deadline.  For example, for short, in-class assessments, if you complete the work and earn the first point for the assignment, but have an error, you would typically have about a week to resubmit the work with corrections.  To resubmit an assignment, bring the revised work to office hours, or make an appointment to go over the revised work with Prof. Smith.

## Collaborative commentary

For our collaborative commentary project, you will in teams to develop a total of four submissions.  We will rotate team membership at mid semester, so that you will participate in one group for the first two submissions, and a different group for the second two submissions.

Each of the four submissions can earn three points.  The first point is for a *complete*, on-time submission from your group.  If your group's work also satisfies all the requirements for a *satisfactory* submission, all members of the group also earn a second point. At the conclusion of each submission, you will evaluate your own contributions and your teammates contributions, using a rubric that we will develop together and agree on prior to the first team assignment.  If the evaluation of your individual contribution satisfies the agreed-upon rubric, you will receive a third point.

## Attendance

Being prepared and attending class earns up to 6 points in this category of your final course.  We have 27 scheduled class meetings. This table summarizes the scale of attendance points:

| Class meetings | Points earned |
| --- | --- |
| 26+ |  6 |
| 25 | 5 |
|24 | 4 |
|23 | 3 |
|22 | 2 |
|< 22 | 0 |

## Determination of final course grade

Your course grade will be recorded from this table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade | Up to 8 in-class assessments (16 possible) | Collaborative contributions to commentary (12 possible) | Individual contributions to commentary (2 possible) | Attendance (6 possible) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 15 | 12 | 2| 6 |
| A- | 14 | 11 |2 | 6 |
| B+ | 14 | 11 |2 |  5 |
| B | 13 | 10 | 2|  5 |
| B- |13 | 10 |2 |  4 |
| C+ | 13 | 9 | 1| 4 |
| C | 12| 9 | 1| 4 |
| C- | 12 | 8 |1|  3 |
| D | 8| 6 | 0| 2 |




# Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics offers a peer-based tutoring program for intermediate Greek students. In 2023-2024, these will include scheduled review and practice sessions on topics we are covering or reviewing.  Please check the course website for dates and times, and for topics planned during the fall semester.




# Policies

## Class attendance

Work in class is an essential component of the course, and regular attendance is required.  (See the course grading rubric in this syllabus for how class attendance contributes to your final course grade.) Excused absences do *not* count against your course grade. If you know of scheduled conflicts with class meeting times, please speak with Prof. Smith as soon as possible to make arrangements ahead of time for how best to make up work for an excused absence.

If you are sick or have symptoms of a possible communicable disease such as COVID, on the other, please do *not* come to class. You should get in touch with Prof. Smith by email as soon as possible to make arrangements for following up on an unplanned excused absence.

## Masking and testing

In August, 2023, COVID infections are again on the rise. It is impossible to foresee how the spread of infections  will develop this semester, and we continue to teach and learn in ways we did not anticipate. We will monitor the spread of the virus and re-evaluate our masking practices periodically throughout the semester.

Because even a "mild" case can have serious consequences for at-risk populations, as the semester begins, medical-grade or better masks are required in class and in drop-in hours until further notice.

Masking is equally uncomfortable for us all, but feeling unsafe creates a poor learning environment so please do your part. Please continue to proactively monitor, test, and isolate at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with any individuals with known infections. We will continue to closely monitor viral surges and current College recommendations in regards to COVID-19 and any other infectious diseases that might emerge as we move through the semester.

## Diversity and Inclusivity

The study of the ancient Mediterranean world belongs to all of us: if you have chosen to study ancient Greek, then you belong here. The diversity that our student body brings to this class is a resource, a strength and a shared benefit for all of us.

In developing this course, our aim has been to make the course materials and our interactions with each other respectful of diversity of all kinds: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.  If you have suggestions about how to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups, please share them.

## Accommodations for disabilities

Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss support services available. The office can be reached by calling 508 793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 215A.

If you are already registered with Disability Services, please let me know as soon as possible, so that I can take account of this in planning for tests or other course activities.
