## Finite verbs

*Finite verb forms* have five properties:

 1. tense
 2. voice
 3. mood
 4. person
 5. number

The *tenses* of finite verbs can be grouped in four systems that express the aspect and time of an action:

| System | Tenses | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The **present system** | present, imperfect | action viewed as  ongoing, repeated or in some sense incomplete |
| The **aorist system** | aorist | action viewed as single, or complete |
| The **future system** | future, future perfect (*rare*) | action has not yet occurred |
| The **perfect system** | perfect, pluperfect | action viewed as completed but emphasizes continuing effect or presence of the result |

| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
