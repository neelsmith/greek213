## Finite verbs

*Finite verb forms* have five properties:

1. tense 
1. voice
1. mood
1. person 
1. number

The *tenses* of finite verbs can be grouped in four systems that express the aspect and time of an action:

| System | Tenses | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The **present system** | present, imperfect | action viewed as  ongoing, repeated or in some sense incomplete | 
| The **aorist system** | aorist | action viewed as single, or complete |
| The **future system** | future, future perfect (*rare*) | action has not yet occurred |
| The **perfect system** | perfect, pluperfect | action viewed as completed but emphasizes continuing effect or presence of the result |

There are three *voices* in Greek:


| System | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- |  --- | 
| The **active voice** | The grammatical subject performs the action |  |
| The **passive voice** | The grammatical subject receives the action | |
| The **middle voice** | Grammatical subjects act on or for themselves | 



| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
